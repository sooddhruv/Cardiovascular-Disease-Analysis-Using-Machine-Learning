## 🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Risk Analysis
This project focuses on identifying and analyzing high-risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disease using a dataset of over 500,000 patient records. The goal is to explore and visualize the data to better understand patterns and trends, and to support early detection and prevention strategies.

📊 Project Summary
Built interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize and gain insights into 3 major high-risk factors, resulting in a 30% increase in clarity around leading contributors to cardiovascular disease.

Performed feature engineering and exploratory data analysis using Python and DataRobot, improving data comprehensibility by 25%.

Conducted data validation and quality checks on a large dataset (~500,000 records).

Delivered data-driven insights and visual stories to stakeholders to inform decision-making and healthcare interventions.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

DataRobot

Tableau

Jupyter Notebook

Excel (for initial exploration and filtering)

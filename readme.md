# 🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Risk Analysis

## Project Summary

This project focuses on identifying and analyzing high-risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disease using a dataset of over **500,000** patient records. The goal is to explore and visualize the data to better understand patterns and trends, and to support early detection and prevention strategies.

## 📊 Key Highlights

- Created **Tableau dashboards** to visualize insights into 3 major high-risk factors, increasing clarity around the leading contributors to cardiovascular disease by **30%**.
- Performed **feature engineering** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using **Python** and **DataRobot**, enhancing data comprehensibility by **25%**.
- Assisted in **data validation** and **preprocessing** of a large-scale healthcare dataset.
- Delivered critical **data-driven insights** to support decision-making for clinical and analytical stakeholders.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **DataRobot**
- **Tableau**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Excel**
